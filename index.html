        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <img src="./img/ethics.jpg" alt="Ethics">
        <p>Ethics is more to do with what is morally right or wrong, not lawful <br>
            A populations morals change often <br>
            Laws are often slow to catch up <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Some ethical dilemas in Tech</h3><br><br>
        <p>
            Should the internet be regulated or should we have complete freedom? </p>
        <p>
            And should there be Government control or should corporations police themselves? </p>
        <p>
            The rise of AI: Will they like us? What if they don't? Should you be aloud to lawfully kill AI? </p>
        <p>
            Autonomous vehicles who's at fault for an accident? Boeing 737 max; the Uber crash in Arizona</p>
        <p>Smart devices are always listening or know where you are...
            <br>
            <em><br>Who controls that data? <br>And what <u>will</u> they do
                with it?</em>

        <h2>Cultural</h2>
        <img src="./img/Christo.jpg" alt="Christ the Redeemer">
        <p>Technology makes the world smaller that can mean that cultures are changing. <br>
            My Family is international!<br>
            Would that have
            happened 20/30/40 years ago?</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the Middle East they worry about Westernism removing their culture and at the same time the Arab spring
            is about people desperately wanting to be more westernised.
        </p>
        <p>
            In-equal development of countries, are more developed countries leaving those less developed behind? or can
            they catch up through technology?.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a proven trend towards the culture of the people that make the applications. Why would an American
            developer care about Korean culture?
        </p>
        <p>China limits what is seen or shared. It says to protect its culture, is that true? </p>
